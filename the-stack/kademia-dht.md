# Kademia DHT

Here is the definition and introduction to [Kademia DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) from wikipedia website:

> Kademlia is a [distributed hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed\_hash\_table) for decentralized [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_network) designed by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazi√®res in 2002.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia#cite\_note-kademlia-paper-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia#cite\_note-2) It specifies the structure of the network and the exchange of information through [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node\_\(networking\)) lookups. Kademlia nodes communicate among themselves using [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User\_Datagram\_Protocol). A virtual or [overlay network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay\_network) is formed by the participant nodes. Each node is identified by a number or _node ID_. The _node ID_ serves not only as identification, but the Kademlia algorithm uses the _node ID_ to locate values (usually file [hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash\_function) or keywords).

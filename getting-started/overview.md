# The Overview

The updated boson retains its decentralized essence and preserves the peer-to-peer  encrypted communication feature from its inception. Evolving with a strategic restructuring, it now operates as a layered and permissionless communication network. This transformation aims to broaden the spectrum of potential applications beyond the secure P2P communication feature. The layered structure, presented from the bottom up, is as follows:

* [**UDP/TCP**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_protocol\_suite)
* [**Kademia DHT**](boson-dht.md)
* [**Boson Protocol**](boson-protocol/)
* [**Boson Service**](boson-services/)
* **Applications**

In this layered structure, it is composed of core protocols UDP/TCP that facilitate the transmission of messages. The upper Kademia DHT serves as a distributed hash table for decentralized peer-to-peer networking. This layer is intricately designed to facilitate information exchange among nodes. Moving up, the Protocol layer encompasses a suite of network protocols that enable communication between nodes. The topmost layer, Boson Service, encompasses a series of services designed to cater to applications. These services include the Web Gateway, Active Proxy, Messaging, and dStore.

Overall, the layered structure offers the network greater scalability and flexibility in terms of application adoption, and also enables more efficient communication between devices, since each layer serves a distinct purpose for applications.

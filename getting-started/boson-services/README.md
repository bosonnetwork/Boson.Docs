# Boson Services

The boson services constitute a comprehensive suite of offerings deployed alongside boson super nodes, serving as the service layer across the network. These services are purposefully designed to address diverse requirements for application adoption, empowering them with seamless integration and enhanced functionality. By leveraging these services, applications gain access to a myriad of innovative features and capabilities, fundamentally transforming the way they operate. 

The propagation and discovery of services hinge on two essential protocols: announcing peers and finding peers. Through announcing peers, services broadcast their presence and availability across the network. Conversely, finding peers enables applications to search and locate the services they intend to leverage. Together, these protocols ensure seamless connectivity and foster efficient peer discovery within the services ecosystem.

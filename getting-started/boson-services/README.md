# Boson Services

The boson services constitute a comprehensive suite of offerings deployed alongside boson super nodes, serving as the service layer across the network. These services are purposefully designed to address diverse requirements for application adoption, empowering them with seamless integration and enhanced functionality. By leveraging these services, applications gain access to a myriad of innovative features and capabilities, fundamentally transforming the way they operate.

### Propagation and Discovery of Services

These two fundamental protocols play a crucial role in the propagation and discovery of services.&#x20;

* announce\_peer
* find\_peer

Through announcing peers, services effectively broadcast their presence and availability across the network. Conversely, finding peers empowers applications to efficiently search and locate the services they intend to leverage. Collectively, these protocols ensure a seamless connectivity experience and foster efficient peer discovery within the services ecosystem.

### The Dedicated Services&#x20;

Here are the Boson services currently supported or planned for support over the network. Typically, these services operate alongside Boson super nodes on public VPS servers.

* [**Web Gateway**](web-gateway.md)
* [**Active Proxy**](active-proxy.md)
* [**Messaging Service**](messaging-service.md)
* [**dStore Service**](dstore-service.md)

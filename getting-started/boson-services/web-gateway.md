# Web Gateway

The <mark style="color:green;">**Web Gateway**</mark> service, offered by the super boson node, is a straightforward web service for the public. It enables lightweight applications, particularly those within browsers, to access certain features of the boson protocols without the need to be working as a full-fledged node. Instead, these applications utilize the super boson node as a gateway, facilitating seamless interaction with the boson network.

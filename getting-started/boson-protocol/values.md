# Values

As a kademia DHT network, the boson network not only provides efficiency routing and lookup mechanism, but also functions as a highly reliable and scalable storage platform for storing and retrieving key-value data. Value can be created by applications by requirement and propagated and stored on the neigbouring nodes across the network. Each stored value entity has a unique value ID as it’s key under the same namespace as node IDs.  Based on the nature and purpose, values are designed as the following categories:

- Immutable Values
- Verifiable Values
- Verifiable Encrypted Values

## Immutable Values

Immutable values are entities

Immutable values are entities that cannot be updated once they are stored in the network, even by the data owner. This immutability ensures the permanence and integrity of the data over time, making it reliable and secure. The value ID of an immutable value is calculated using SHA-256 for the value data, which can also be treated as a CID (Content ID).

## Mutable Values

Mutable values are entities that can be updated only by the owner after they are published and stored in the network. This type of values has a public key, a nonce, a sequence number and signature proof along with the contained data.  Each mutable value must be bound with a pair keys used for signing and verifying, where the private is used to generate the signature proof based on data content, and the public key is used to verify the integrity and ownership of the data content.  And the private key is kept and ensured it’s security by the data owner himself.

The ID of a mutable value is generated by applying SHA-256 algorithm on the associated public key and nonce. This ID remains the same even if the value is updated. The nonce can be varied when a user uses the same key pair to generate a suite of data values for different purposes.

## Encrypted Values

Encrypted values are similar to mutable values in that they can be updated by the data owner after being stored in the network. However, the difference lies in the fact that the data in encrypted values is encrypted, while the data in mutable values is a plain data. An encrypted value shares the same properties as a mutable value, such as a public key, nonce, sequence number, and signature proof.

The ID of an encrypted value is similar to that of mutable values. It also utilizes the SHA-256 algorithm on the associated public key and nonce. The encrypted value can only be decrypted by a designated node with a specified nodeID in the value entity. When the intended recipient node receives the encrypted value, it uses its private key to decrypt the data and process it.

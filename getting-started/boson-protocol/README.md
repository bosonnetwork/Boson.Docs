# Boson Protocol

The boson network stands as a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer encrypted communication platform, with Kademlia DHT serving as its underlying network. A meticulously implemented suite of protocols is designed to facilitate seamless communication among nodes. These primitive protocols listed below cover the addressing and propagation of nodes, values, and peer entities throughout the entire network, which are outlined in the initial standard specification:

* find\_node
* store\_value
* find\_value
* announce\_peer
* find\_peer

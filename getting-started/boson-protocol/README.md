# Boson Protocol

The boson network stands as a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer encrypted communication platform, with Kademlia DHT serving as its underlying network. A meticulously implemented suite of protocols is designed to facilitate seamless communication among nodes. These protocols cover the addressing and propagation of nodes, values, and peer entities throughout the entire network. The following suite of protocols represents the primitive protocols outlined in the initial standard specification:

* ping
* find\_node
* store\_value
* find\_value
* announce\_peer
* find\_peer

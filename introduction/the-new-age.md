# The New Age

## The New Carrier 2.0

While the legacy carrier has had a significant impact on the community, its inherent limitations have resulted in limited adoption of the applications. The new version of the carrier features a well-layered and modularized service architecture that offers many more possibilities for application adoption. Additionally, the new carrier has grown into a fully permissionless communication network compared to the legacy version, which was a permissioned network.&#x20;

## The Strengths of New Carrier 2.0

The new carrier has been fully developed from scratch with thorough consideration to resolve the remaining issues on the legacy carrier, especially the limited possibilities for application adoption.&#x20;

Firstly, the new carrier has become a fully permissionless communication network compared to the legacy carrier, which was a permissioned communication network that required peers to become friends first before communicating. As a result, any application can run as a carrier node to propagate messages to others, as long as those messages are validated and fully comply with the specification protocols. This opens up more possibilities for use cases as more protocols are contributed by the community.

The new carrier has been designed as a three-layered structure consisting of the DHT, protocol, and service layers, along with the bottom UDP/TCP protocols and the uppermost layer for application adoption, to compose the entire carrier network.

# ðŸ”† Setting up Carrier super node

{% hint style="info" %}
_It's recommended to install the Carrier super node on **Ubuntu 22.04** or later, and bind it to a public IP address._
{% endhint %}

## Installation of runtime dependencies

The following runtime components as dependencies required to be installed before the installation of **Carrier super node**:

* Java Virtual Machine (JVM) >= Java 11
* sodium (libsodium) >= 1.0.16

To install these dependencies, please run the following commands:

{% code fullWidth="true" %}
```sh
$ sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless libsodium23
```
{% endcode %}

## Building your debian package

Ensure that JDK-11 has been installed on your building machine before building the Carrier super node, where usually it's referred as Carrier daemon debian package. Use the following command to carry out the whole building process:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:elastos/Elastos.Carrier.Java.git  Carrier.Java
$ cd Carrier.Java
$ ./mvnw -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

Once the build process finishes, the debian package will be generated under the directory `launcher/target` with the pattern name _**carrier-launcher-\<version>-\<timestamp>.deb**,_ where <_**version**_> and <_**timestamp**_> values will vary depending on the specific version being built.

## Installing the Carrier super node

After uploading the debian package to the target machine, run the following command to install the Carrier super node:

```sh
$ sudo dpkg -i carrier-launcher-<version>-<timestamp>.deb
```

The Carrier super node installation includes several directories and files with the structure organized as follows:&#x20;

> * **/usr/lib/carrier**:  contains the runtime libraries, including jar packages
> * **/etc/carrier**:  contains the configuration file **default.conf**
> * **/var/lib/carrier**:  contains the runtime data store
> * **/var/log/carrier**: contains the output log file **carrier.log**
> * **/var/run/carrier**: contains the runtime directory.

The data cached under **`/var/lib/carrier`** is organized into the following structure:

> * **/var/lib/carrier/key**: contains a randomly generated private key
> * **/var/lib/carrier/id**: contains the node ID
> * **/var/lib/carrier/dht4.cache**: contains the routing table information for IPv4 addresses
> * _**/var/lib/carrier/dht6.cache**_: contains the routing table information for IPv6 addresses if IPv6 is enabled
> * **/var/lib/carrier/node.db**: contains the information about Value and PeerInfo

## Opening specified port

Once the Carrier super node has been installed as a service, it is necessary to open the designated port for usage (the default is **`39001`**):

```sh
$ sudo ufw allow 39001/udp
```

To check if the port is accessible, use the following command. Additionally, you can review the log file for more detailed information on the current running status:

```sh
$ sudo ufw status verbose
$ tail -f /var/log/carrier/carrier.log
```

We would also recommend using the '**`systemctl`**' command to check the status of the Carrier daemon service or to start/stop the service:

```sh
$ systemctl status carrier
$ sudo systemctl start carrier
$ sudo systemctl stop carrier
```

## A config example

To officially launch the Carrier super node to improve the health of the Carrier network, the service config file should be updated with the following contents:

```json
{
  "ipv4": true,
  "ipv6": false,
  "address4": "your-ipv4-address",
  "address6": "your-ipv6-address",
  "port": 39001,
  "dataDir": "/var/lib/carrier",

  "bootstraps": [
    {

    },

    }
  ] 
}
```

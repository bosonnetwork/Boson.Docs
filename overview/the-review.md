# 🐾 The Review

{% hint style="info" %}
**Elastos Carrier** was originally designed as a fully decentralized and encrypted peer-to-peer (**P2P**) communication platform, known as the classic Carrier version 1.0.
{% endhint %}

## The R**etrospect** of Carrier 1.0

The **Carrier 1.0** or **Carrier Classic** is the first version of Elastos carrier infrastructure dedicated to being a fully decentralized and encrypted peer-to-peer communication platform that routes network traffic between dApps (_Decentralized_ _Applications_). &#x20;

The version 1.0 provides a package of communication features with a pipeline of design in structural implementation. Users can choose from a variety of layered communication features to fulfill their requirements. Below is a list of the available features:

* Instant Short **Messaging**
* **Session** establishment and communication for streaming
* **Multiplexing** management
* **Port forwarding** service
* Secure and reliable **file transfer** mechanism
* **WebRTC**

## The Shortcomings of Carrier 1.0

The **Carrier Classic** is a fully decentralized and encrypted peer-to-peer communication platform with unique features and strengths. However, as a general communication platform, it has the following shortcomings:

* To communicate, the two peers need to become friends first. This narrows down the adoption scenarios to instant messaging (IM) applications.
* Both peers need to be online at the same time for successful message or data delivery. Therefore, applications need to be kept running in the foreground to keep the peers online and able to communicate.

Due to the aforementioned limitations in meeting the solid needs of applications, a new and advanced version of **Elastos Carrier**, known as **Carrier Version 2.0**, has been developed. The initial version of this new update has already been released.

## Repositories of Carrier 1.0

We have suspended the development of Carrier version 1.0, but we will continue to maintain it until all customizers have migrated to Carrier 2.0. Below is a list of the main repositories for Carrier 1.0:

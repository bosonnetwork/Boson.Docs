# üêæ The Past

## A dedicated communication platform - Carrier Classic

The **Carrier Classic** or **Carrier Version 1.0** is the first version of Elastos Carrier infrastructure dedicated to being a fully decentralized and encrypted **peer-to-peer** communication platform that routes network traffic between **dApps** (_Decentralized_ _Applications_). &#x20;

The **Classic classic** provides a package of communication features with the pipeline design, and users can use any layered communication features to fulfill the requirements.  Here are the list of layered communication features below:

* **Instant messaging**
* **Session** establishment and communication for audio/video traffic&#x20;
* **Multiplexing**
* **Port forwarding** service for TCP connection
* Secure and reliable **file transfer** mechanism
* **WebRTC** on session

## The deficiencies of Carrier classic

The **Carrier classic** has its own features and strengths of being a fully decentralized and encrypted P2P communication, and various adoptions have been trying on the integration. But as a general communication platform, **Carrier classic** has the following drawbacks:

* The two peers to participate communication need to be friends first, which would naturally narrow the adoption scenarios falling into **Instant Messaging** (**IM**) applications;
* The two peers to communicate need to being online at same time period, otherwise,  messages or data would be delivered in failure.  In this case, it requires applications to keep running in foregound so as to keep peers being online to able to communicate.

Given the reasons above that could not perfectly meet the solid needs from the applications, the new and advanced version of Elastos Carrier, also known as **Carrier Version 2.0** has been developing and the first inital version has already came out.

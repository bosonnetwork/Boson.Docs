## # The Main Concepts

### Carrier Super Node

A carrier super node, also known as a bootstrap node, is a special type of carrier node dedicated to helping new nodes join the carrier network. It achieves this by propagating nodes into the routing tables of neighboring carrier nodes, and keeping the routing tables of neighboring nodes healthy and robust. Since carrier super nodes serve as bootstrap node, they must run on a VPS with a public IP address.

### Carrier Regular Node

### Carrier Light Node

### Active Proxy

# üéÜ Kademia DHT

Here is the definition and introduction to [Kademia DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia) from wikipedia website:

> Kademlia is a [distributed hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed\_hash\_table) for decentralized peer-to-peer computer networks designed by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazi√®res in 2002. It specifies the structure of the network and the exchange of information through node lookups. Kademlia nodes communicate among themselves using UDP. A virtual or [overlay network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay\_network) is formed by the participant nodes. Each node is identified by a number or _node ID_. The _node ID_ serves not only as identification, but the Kademlia algorithm uses the _node ID_ to locate values (usually file hashes or keywords).

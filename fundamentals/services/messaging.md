# Messaging

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature has not been implemented yet, but it is already on the list of planned features. We will share more detials later when it's ready to implement.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
With utilizing the carrier network protocols with methods like "store/find value" and "announce/find peers", we will implement a decentralized but federal-centric communication platform on top of carrier network. Each actor or participator need to be dockered on one of super node that provide communication service,  and it will communicate with other actors thorough this super node and the other one that docks the opposite participator.  But the data through the communication channels still is being fully encrypted and secure. \
A similar "mastondon" communication application can leverage this tech on Carrier network, but defenitely would be more flexiable and less central censorship.&#x20;

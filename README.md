# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Carrier 2.0

{% hint style="info" %}
Throughout the documentation website, the terms **Carrier Legacy** or **Carrier Classic** refer to carrier version 1.0, while the term **New Carrier** or simply **Carrier** is used to refer to carrier version 2.0 or any new version in the future.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

**Carrier** has been an essential component of the Elastos ecosystem since its inception. As a completely decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) communication network, it provides reliable communication and data sharing capabilities without relying on any central authorities and risking data leakage.&#x20;

Due to limited adoptions of the legacy version 1.0, Carrier has continued to evolve and improve over time. With a newly well-layered architecture and expanded possibilities for application adoption, Carrier remains a critical component of the Elastos Ecosystem. It plays a crucial role in its success and continued growth.

Below is a list of brief introductions to the Carrier project from the past, present, and future:

* [**The Legacy** ](introduction/the-legacy.md) - A retrospective of carrier version 1.0
* [**The New Age**](introduction/the-new-age.md) - The improved carrier version 2.0
* [**The Outlook** ](introduction/the-outlook.md)- The vision of carrier for the future

## Get started

If you're new to the Carrier project, it's recommended that you first gain an overview understanding of the new Carrier network. Carrier is a well-layered, permissionless communication network, where each layer serves its own specific purpose for the entire Carrier network. Below are recommended steps to learn about Carrier:

* [**The overview of Carrier Network**](./#overview)
* [**Carrier protocols**](fundamental/carrier-protocol/) - The carrier defined protocols from CIP
* [**Carrier Services**](fundamental/carrier-services/) - The built-in system level services

Once you have a basic understanding of the Carrier network, it is recommended that you practice by deploying a Carrier super node. This will allow you to run a local service on your development machine or Raspberry device utilizing the ActiveProxy service. Below are the recommended steps to practice using Carrier:

* [**Deploy a Carrier super node**](fundamental/practices/setting-up-carrier-super-node.md)
* [**Utilize the ActiveProxy service to run a local service**](fundamental/practices/walk-through-active-proxy-service.md)
* [**Practice using Carrier by following the recommended steps**](fundamental/practices/practice-in-shell.md)

## Deep Dive

Once you have a thorough understanding of the Carrier project, it's time to dive deep into the SDKs and APIs for different versions of Carrier project. This is the next step in your journey to integrate Carrier into your applications.

* [**Java SDK and APIs**](developer/java.md)
* [**C/C++ Native SDK and APIs**](developer/c-c++.md)
* [**Swift/iOS APIs and SDK**](http://localhost:5000/o/-MiuJMlYEx2aazGrKrUY/s/vUu27GQSAeqmivH4yylC/)
* [**Javascript Lite SDK and APIs**](developer/javascript.md)

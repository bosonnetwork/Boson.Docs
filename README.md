# Welcome to Boson

## Overview

**Boson** network is a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) communication network that provides reliable communication and data sharing capabilities without the need for a central registry. It was initially derived from the Elastos Carrier open source project and has since undergone further development and enhancements.

The new version of **Boson** introduces a well-layered and modularized service architecture, opening up new possibilities for application adoption. Furthermore, **Boson** has transitioned into a fully permissionless communication network.

## Getting started

If you are new to Boson, it is recommended to begin by developing a comprehensive understanding of the network. Boson is a meticulously designed, permissionless communication network, with each layer serving a distinct purpose within the overall framework. To facilitate your learning journey, consider following these recommended steps:

* [**The overview of Boson network**](./#overview)
* [**Boson protocols**](getting-started/boson-protocol/) - The boson-defined protocols from BIP
* [**Boson services**](getting-started/boson-services/) - The services provided by boson super nodes

Once you've acquired a foundational understanding of the Boson network, it is highly recommended to gain practical experience by deploying a Boson super node on a public VPS server. Following this, we suggest running a local personal service on a Raspberry Pi device at your home, leveraging the active proxy service.

To assist you in effectively practicing with Boson technology, here is a list of recommended guidelines:

* [**Deploy a boson super node**](getting-started/practices/deploying-super-node.md)
* [**Leveraging the active proxy service to run a personal service**](getting-started/practices/leveraging-active-proxy-service.md)
* [**Understanding boson node by practicing an interactive shell command**](getting-started/practices/the-interactive-shell-command.md)

## In-depth tech

After gaining a fundamental understanding of the network, it's time to delve deeper into the technology and explore the available SDKs and APIs for seamlessly integrating Boson into your own applications. To guide you in this final step of your integration journey, here is a curated collection of SDKs for your reference:

* [**Java SDK**](developer-kits/java.md)
* [**C/C++ Native SDK**](developer-kits/c-c++.md)

# Welcome to Boson

## Overview

**Boson** network is a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) communication network that provides reliable communication and data sharing capabilities without the need for a central registry. It originated as a fork from the Elastos **Carrier** open source project and has continued to evolve and improve over time.

The latest version of **Boson** introduces a well-layered and modularized service architecture, opening up new possibilities for application adoption. Furthermore, **Boson** has transitioned into a fully permissionless communication network.

## Getting started

If you're new to Boson, it is recommended that you first gain an overview understanding of the network. Boson is a well-layered, permission-less communication network where each layer serves a specific purpose for the entire network. Here are the recommended steps to learn about it:

* [**The overview of Boson network**](./#overview)
* [**Boson protocols**](getting-started/boson-protocol/) - The boson-defined protocols from BIP
* [**Boson services**](getting-started/boson-services/) - The services provided by boson super nodes

Once you have a basic understanding of the boson network, it is recommended that you practice in deploying a boson super node on a public VPS server. Next, we suggest that you run a local personal service on Raspberry Pi device at your home by using the active proxy service.&#x20;

Here is a list of recommended guidelines for practicing with boson tech:

* [**Deploy a boson super node**](getting-started/practices/deploying-super-node.md)
* [**Leveraging the active proxy service to run a personal service**](getting-started/practices/leveraging-active-proxy-service.md)
* [**Understanding boson node by practicing an interactive shell command**](getting-started/practices/the-interactive-shell-command.md)

## In-depth tech

Once you have a general understanding of the network, it's time to dive into the technology in-depth and check the SDKs and APIs for your own applications to integrate. Here is a set of SDKs in different languages for the final step in your journey to integrate the boson into your applications:

* [**Java SDK**](developer-kits/java.md)
* [**C/C++ Native SDK**](developer-kits/c-c++.md)

## Contributions

We welcome contributions from passionate developers in the open-source community who aspire to create a secure, decentralized communication platform and help expand the capabilities of this project to achieve wider adoption. Below is the main list of repositories where you can create issues or push pull-requests to contribute:

* [**Boson Java**](https://github.com/bosonnetwork/Boson.Java)
* [**Boson Native**](https://github.com/bosonnetwork/Boson.Native)

We also welcome community involvement in improving the CIP specifications and publishing boson super nodes for public use. You are also welcome to join our dedicated Telegram group to get more details and updates about the Carrier network.

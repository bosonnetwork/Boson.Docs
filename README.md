# Welcome to Carrier 2.0

{% hint style="info" %}
Throughout the documentation website, the terms **Carrier Legacy** or **Carrier Classic** refer to carrier version 1.0, while the term **New Carrier** or simply **Carrier** is used to refer to carrier version 2.0 or any new version in the future.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

**Carrier** has been an essential component of the **Elastos** ecosystem since its inception. As a completely decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) communication network, it provides reliable communication and data sharing capabilities without relying on a central registry and risking data leakage.

Due to limited adoptions of the legacy version 1.0, Carrier has continued to evolve and improve over time. With a newly well-layered architecture and expanded possibilities for application adoption, the carrier remains a critical component of the Elastos ecosystem. It keeps playing a crucial role in its success and continued growth.

Below is a list of brief introductions to the carrier project from the past, present, and future:

* [**The Legacy** ](introduction/the-legacy.md) - A retrospective of carrier version 1.0
* [**The New Age**](introduction/the-new-age.md) - The improved carrier version 2.0
* [**The Outlook** ](introduction/the-outlook.md)- The vision of carrier for the future

## Getting started

If you're new to the carrier project, it's recommended that you first gain an overview understanding of the new carrier network. Carrier is a well-layered, permissionless communication network, where each layer serves its own specific purpose for the entire carrier network. Here are the recommended steps to learn about Carrier:

* [**The overview of carrier network**](./#overview)
* [**Carrier protocols**](getting-started/carrier-protocol/) - The carrier-defined protocols from CIP
* [**Carrier services**](getting-started/carrier-services/) - The services customizedly provided by carrier super nodes

Once you have a basic understanding of the carrier network, it is recommended that you practice by deploying a carrier super node on a public VPS server. Next, we suggest that you run a local service on your development machine or Raspberry Pi device using the active proxy service.&#x20;

Here is a list of recommended guidelines for practicing with carrier tech:

* [**Deploy a carrier super node**](getting-started/practices/deploying-a-super-node.md)
* [**Utilize the ActiveProxy service to run a local service**](getting-started/practices/leverage-the-activeproxy-service.md)
* [**Practice using Carrier by following the recommended steps**](getting-started/practices/practice-in-shell.md)

## In-depth tech

Once you have a general understanding of the carrier project, it's time to dive into the technology in-depth and check the SDKs and APIs. Here is a set of SDKs in different languages for the final step in your journey to integrate carrier into your applications:

* [**Java SDK**](developer-kits/java.md)
* [**C/C++ Native SDK**](developer-kits/c-c++.md)
* [**Swift iOS SDK**](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/-MiuJMlYEx2aazGrKrUY/s/vUu27GQSAeqmivH4yylC/)
* [**Javascript Lite SDK**](developer-kits/javascript.md)

## Contributions

We welcome contributions from passionate developers in the open-source community who aspire to create a secure, decentralized communication platform and help expand the capabilities of the carrier project to achieve wider adoption. Below is a list of repositories for the Carrier project where you can create issues or push pull-requests to contribute:

* [**Carrier Java**](https://github.com/elastos/Elastos.Carrier.Java)

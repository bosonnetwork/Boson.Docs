#### The drawbacks of Carrier Classic platform

Carrier Classic has its own specialty and strengths, and a few experimental adoption applications have been trying on top of it. But as a general communication platform, Carrier Classic has the following drawbacks:

* The two peers to communicate with each other need to become friends at first, which would restrict Carrier adoption to very narrow scenarios, like IM application;
* The two peers to communicate both need to be being online at same time period, and no offline messaing features are supported. Therefore, it will require applications integrated Carrier to be running in foreground.

Given the reasons above that barely can meet the solid needs from the applications, the new and advanced version of Carrier, called Carrier Version 2 has been developing and the first inital version has been released.

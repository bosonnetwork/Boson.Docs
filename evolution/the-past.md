#### The drawbacks of Carrier Classic platform

Carrier Classic has its own specialty and strengths, and a few experimental adoption applications were tried on top of it. But as a general communication platform, Classic Classic has the following drawbacks:

* The two peers to communicate with each other need to become friends at first, which would would restrict Carrier adoption to narrow scenarios, like IM application;
* The two peers to communicate both need to be being online, and there is no offline messaing features supported. Therefore, it will require applications integrated Carrier to be running in foreground.
